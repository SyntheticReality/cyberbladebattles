**Last Updated:** 4 July 2025

This Cookie Policy explains how OSYRYS (“Osyrys,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) uses cookies and similar tracking technologies
when you visit our website https://cyberbladebattles.com (the “Site”) or any web pages, landing pages, or online
services that link to this Policy (collectively, the “Web Services”). It should be read together with our Privacy
Policy.

By continuing to browse or use the Web Services, you agree that we can store and access cookies as described in this
Policy. You can withdraw or modify your consent at any time as detailed below.

## 1. WHAT ARE COOKIES?

Cookies are small text files that a website places on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. They allow
the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, and display settings) over a period of
time, so you do not have to re‑enter them whenever you return.

“First‑party cookies” are set by the Site you are visiting. “Third‑party cookies” are set by a domain other than the
Site (for example, an analytics provider).

We may allow selected third parties (e.g., Google, Meta Pixel, Discord widgets) to set cookies when you interact with
embedded content or social‑media plugins. We do not control the data collected by these parties and recommend that you
review their respective privacy policies.

## 4. HOW TO CONTROL COOKIES
