**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025

These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) are a legally binding agreement between OSYRYS ("Osyrys," "we," "us," or "our") and
you ("you" or "User") governing your access to and use of the video game Cyberblade Battles and any related services,

  and accepted these Terms on your behalf.

If you do not agree, you must not use the Services.

## 1. ACCOUNTS & ELIGIBILITY
