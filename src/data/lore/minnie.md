to [Osyrys](https://www.notion.so/Osyrys-16c7b60d6f9680719581ca4180a66513?pvs=21)’s highest rooftop venue. This towering
sanctuary has since become the epicenter for elite cyberblade and net runners—those bold enough to stand against both
corporate domination and governmental overreach. The skybar itself, perched atop the glittering skyline, serves as a
gathering point for [Osyrys](https://www.notion.so/Osyrys-16c7b60d6f9680719581ca4180a66513?pvs=21)’s most skilled
