### Overview

ADs are cutting-edge combat machines piloted remotely by [Cyberblade Runner](https://www.notion.so/Cyberblade-Runner-16c7b60d6f9680a9b464d57b42d43800?pvs=21) through **Neural Link Virtual Reality (NLVR)** systems. Designed for urban warfare, infiltration, and tactical operations, these machines are equipped with advanced locomotion systems and customizable combat modules, making them adaptable to a wide range of scenarios.

[Cyberblade Runner](https://www.notion.so/Cyberblade-Runner-16c7b60d6f9680a9b464d57b42d43800?pvs=21) do not simply control ADs—they merge with them, achieving a level of precision and responsiveness that mimics their own bodies. This unique connection is made possible by neural interfaces installed directly into their brains, allowing for seamless, high-bandwidth communication with the AV.

### Neural Link Integration

[Cyberblade Runner](https://www.notion.so/Cyberblade-Runner-16c7b60d6f9680a9b464d57b42d43800?pvs=21) connect to their ADs through NLVR rigs—highly advanced systems that synchronize their neural activity with the AD's systems. These rigs utilize two-way feedback loops, allowing [Cyberblade Runner](https://www.notion.so/Cyberblade-Runner-16c7b60d6f9680a9b464d57b42d43800?pvs=21) to experience the machine as an extension of their own body. The neural interface provides an unmatched level of control, precision, and responsiveness, enabling maneuvers and combat tactics that are impossible with traditional piloting methods.

However, this integration comes with significant risks. The two-way feedback system means that while the AD transmits real-time sensory and environmental data to the operator, it can also be a vulnerability. If an AD is hacked, it can emit critical or even fatal feedback back to the NLVR rig. While most Cyberblade Runners survive the destruction of their ADs unscathed, there have been documented cases of severe neural feedback causing catastrophic damage, including death. This risk necessitates extreme cybersecurity measures and constant vigilance during missions.

### Legacy

RCUs are the pinnacle of combat technology in [Osyrys](https://www.notion.so/Osyrys-16c7b60d6f9680719581ca4180a66513?pvs=21), representing the perfect fusion of human ingenuity and mechanical precision. Their modularity and adaptability make them invaluable tools for Cyberblade Runners, whose mastery of NLVR systems elevates these machines beyond simple tools of war. The risks and rewards of piloting ADs have created a culture of both reverence and caution among Cyberblade Runners, further cementing their status as legendary operatives in the physical and digital battlefields of Osyrys.
