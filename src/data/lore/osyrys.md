- **Location**: International waters

**Osyrys** emerged in international waters as a haven for a new breed of entrepreneur-trillionaires committed to
radical, freedom-focused technology accelerationist capitalism. Rejecting traditional currencies, Osyrys uses an
exclusive cryptocurrency to facilitate its fluid economy, with AI serving as the software layer that governs every
aspect of its societyâ€”from automated security to real-time urban management.

Fuelled by cutting-edge robotics and unrestrained innovation, the city rapidly became a magnet for global talent. Over
time, however, its unchecked growth led to an anarcho-capitalist environment, where power belongs to those who can
outmaneuver rivals in a perpetual scramble for resources and influence.
