### Biography

Pantera is a
legendary [Cyberblade Runner](https://www.notion.so/Cyberblade-Runner-16c7b60d6f9680a9b464d57b42d43800?pvs=21) known for
his deadly precision, swift reflexes, and unshakable calm under pressure. With roots in the Hispanic underworld, Pantera
climbed the ranks to become one of the most respected cyberblade mercenaries
in [Osyrys](https://www.notion.so/Osyrys-16c7b60d6f9680719581ca4180a66513?pvs=21), often working as a freelance
operative for the notorious mercenary
group [Wolf’s Head](https://www.notion.so/Wolf-s-Head-13d7b60d6f968174b99ef01065075bda?pvs=21). His career was marked by
clean, efficient, and near-flawless executions, a reputation that earned him both respect and fear among his peers and
clients.

After a lifetime of intense missions and high-stakes contracts, Pantera has decided to leave the world of mercenary work
behind, stepping back from the neon-lit battlegrounds
of [Osyrys](https://www.notion.so/Osyrys-16c7b60d6f9680719581ca4180a66513?pvs=21). Now, he lives a quieter life in less
turbulent districts, content with watching the cyber-crazed world pass by from the sidelines. Despite his retired
status, Pantera remains a respected name, a legend among cyberblade runners with a reputation that persists even in his
absence from the action.

### Personality

Pantera is characterized by a cool, unflinching demeanor that reflects years of experience in the dangerous world of
cyberblade running. Known for his calm, almost zen-like approach to missions, he rarely loses his temper and maintains a
sense of balance and composure even in the most intense situations. This same personality now guides his life away from
the chaos, where he prefers quiet nights, good company, and the occasional thrill of sparring with younger runners who
seek his mentorship.

### Skills and Fighting Style

As a [Cyberblade Runner](https://www.notion.so/Cyberblade-Runner-16c7b60d6f9680a9b464d57b42d43800?pvs=21), Pantera was a
master of close-quarters combat, known for his fluid and adaptive fighting style. His movements are agile yet
calculated, combining speed with the precision of a seasoned professional. His moniker, "Pantera" (Spanish for
“Panther”), reflects both his stealth and his ability to strike with lethal force.

Even now, in retirement, Pantera pilots his sleek,
black [Combat Unit (CU)](https://www.notion.so/Combat-Unit-CU-16c7b60d6f9680faa998d8168b849eea?pvs=21), a relic of his
mercenary days, for sparring and occasional contracts. The RCU is a customized unit equipped with enhanced agility,
precision cyberblades, and stealth modules, reflecting Pantera’s personal combat philosophy. While he rarely enters the
battlefield, when he does, it’s with the same lethal efficiency that defined his prime, reminding everyone why his name
still commands respect.

### Relationship with Wolf’s Head

Though he no longer takes on regular contracts, Pantera maintains an amicable relationship
with [Wolf’s Head](https://www.notion.so/Wolf-s-Head-13d7b60d6f968174b99ef01065075bda?pvs=21). Younger Wolf’s Head
recruits often seek him out for guidance or training, and Pantera is known to impart his wisdom to those he deems
worthy, though he keeps his mentorship low-key and prefers to avoid any formal commitment.

unyielding professionalism have set a standard in the cyberblade community, especially among those who work with Wolf’s
Head. Though retired, Pantera’s legacy continues to shape the ethos of Wolf’s Head and inspires cyberblade runners who
