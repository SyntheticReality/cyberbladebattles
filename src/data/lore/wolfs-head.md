### Overview

**Wolf’s Head** is an exclusive organization of elite cyberblade runners, notorious for their skills and willingness to
take on high-risk mercenary contracts. Known for their loyalty to their own code rather than any government,
corporation, or ideology, Wolf’s Head operates as a self-contained force within the chaotic world of Osyrys. Their
clientele spans mega-corporations, powerful individuals, and shadowy organizations that require precision, discretion,
and unflinching ruthlessness.

A defining trait of Wolf’s Head is their insistence on membership exclusivity—only the most skilled and proven
cyberblade runners are accepted, and those who join are sworn to secrecy and bound by the Wolf’s Head code of honor. To
the rest of Osyrys, Wolf’s Head represents the pinnacle of the mercenary world: efficient, elite, and willing to
complete any mission for the right price.

### Code of the Wolf

While they are loyal to no one except their own, Wolf’s Head members abide by a strict code that defines the group’s
approach to mercenary work. This “Code of the Wolf” includes principles of secrecy and commitment to completing
contracts. However, should the mission call for it, they won’t hesitate to eliminate obstacles without mercy. The code
forbids betrayal of fellow Wolf’s Head members, and internal disputes are resolved within the group’s own ranks.

### Activities and Operations

Wolf’s Head operates on the fringes of legality, taking on contracts that range from high-stakes infiltration and data
theft to high-profile extractions and targeted eliminations. Their missions often involve the use of cyberblade combat,
stealth, and advanced hacking to infiltrate well-guarded facilities and acquire valuable intel, making them both feared
and respected in the corporate and criminal underworlds.

### Notable Missions

- **Midnight Mirage**: A high-profile operation in which Wolf’s Head runners
  eliminated [Skull & Bones](https://www.notion.so/Skull-Bones-13d7b60d6f96813992f0dc1127b13171?pvs=21) terrorists that
  had captured a private school for wealthy families.
- **Dawn’s Rescue**: Tasked with extracting the kidnapped daughter
  of [Osyrys](https://www.notion.so/Osyrys-16c7b60d6f9680719581ca4180a66513?pvs=21)’s ambassador to the Global Council,
  Wolf’s Head located and neutralized her captors.

### Recruitment and Membership

Wolf’s Head membership is reserved for the most capable and battle-tested cyberblade runners. Recruitment is by
invitation only, with candidates handpicked for their skill, loyalty, and fearlessness. Each new member must undergo a
rigorous initiation mission, proving their worth and commitment to the code.

Following the mission, candidates must partake in a secretive initiation ritual, one that is said to bind them in blood
to the pack. The details of this ritual remain shrouded in mystery, known only to full-fledged members. Rumors speak of
trials that test not just skill but unwavering loyalty, leaving those who complete it forever changed. Members operate
in small squads or individually, depending on mission requirements, and often move between hidden safehouses scattered
throughout Osyrys.

### Legacy and Impact

Wolf’s Head’s presence has become a fixture within the mercenary landscape of Osyrys. Known for their unmatched
efficiency and fierce independence, they are the top choice for clients seeking an elite team that will complete a
mission without questions or entanglements. The organization’s reputation as a highly disciplined, effective, and
discreet group of cyberblade runners has solidified their place as one of the most powerful mercenary forces in the
metaverse. To Osyrys’s tech elite, hiring Wolf’s Head means one thing: the job will get done, no matter the odds or
obstacles.

### Code of the Wolf

Wolf’s Head operates under a stringent internal code that governs its members’ conduct, ensuring unity and discipline:

1. **Secrecy Above All**: Members must never reveal Wolf’s Head operations, affiliations, or internal disputes to
   outsiders. Punishable by death.
2. **Contracts Are Sacred**: Once accepted, a mission is completed at all costs—failure is not an option.
3. **Unity in the Pack**: Betraying a fellow member is punishable by capture and execution. The pack will make this
   their number one mission.
