- **Alignment**: Lawful Evil
- **Leader**: Baldwin

### Overview

Skull and Bones is a radical organization that opposes the rise of cyber-augmentations, robotics, and cyberblade
runners. Driven by a fierce commitment to maintaining human purity, the group believes that technology’s encroachment on
the human experience poses a grave threat to humanity’s essence. They view cyberblade runners, netrunners, and the
cyber-augmented as symbols of a lost identity, and are notorious for their aggressive tactics, which often border on
terrorism.

Formed in response to the rapid growth of tech conglomerates and their influence over society, Skull and Bones operates
in the shadows, engaging in acts of sabotage and propaganda aimed at disrupting technology’s hold on Osyrys. Their
mission is simple but extreme: to halt what they see as humanity's descent into technological dependency and reclaim the
purity of the human experience.

### Ideology

Skull and Bones is united under a doctrine they call “Human Purity.” According to this ideology, cyber-augmentations,
body modifications, and digital integration erode the very essence of humanity, turning people into machines controlled
by corporate and governmental interests. They view those who undergo cybernetic enhancement as traitors to the human
race, believing that the human body and mind should remain unaltered, free from artificial interference.

Their members see cyberblade runners and netrunners as the epitome of this “dehumanization,” individuals who have
willingly forfeited their humanity for power and profit. In the eyes of Skull and Bones, these augmented individuals
pose an existential threat to human identity and autonomy.

### Activities

Skull and Bones is infamous for its violent methods, which include attacks on cybernetics labs, corporate facilities,
and any institutions that promote technological advancement or cyber-augmentation. Known for their “purity raids,” they
often target those who they deem to be “corrupted” by technology, launching surprise strikes on clinics, tech hubs, and
the homes of prominent figures in the tech world. Their approach to activism often leaves a trail of destruction and
chaos, with casualties on both sides of the conflict.

### Notable Incidents

- **Operation Iron Purge**: A large-scale attack on
  a [Combat Unit (CU)](https://www.notion.so/Combat-Unit-CU-16c7b60d6f9680faa998d8168b849eea?pvs=21) factory operated
  by [Syry Technologies](https://www.notion.so/Syry-Technologies-16c7b60d6f9680eb8100ff439b0deb87?pvs=21), resulting in
  extensive damage and the destruction of experimental augmentations.
- **The Great Firewall Incident**: A coordinated propaganda campaign in which Skull and Bones hacked government
  communication channels, broadcasting anti-augmentation messages across Osyrys.

### Recruitment and Organization

Skull and Bones recruits from the disenfranchised sectors of Osyrys, especially those who have been directly impacted by
automation, corporate expansion, or technological unemployment. Disillusioned by the idea of becoming “obsolete” in a
world of machines, these individuals are drawn to the group’s promises of a return to human purity and simplicity.

The group operates as a loosely organized network of cells, making it difficult for authorities to fully dismantle. Each
cell operates independently, united by the ideology of human purity but acting on its own terms. This decentralized
approach allows them to evade detection and maintain secrecy even as they carry out high-profile attacks.

### Legacy and Impact

Despite their controversial methods, Skull and Bones has a significant following among those who feel alienated in the
cyber-dominated world of Osyrys. They are viewed as extremists by the general public, but to their supporters, they are
the last line of defense against an inevitable loss of humanity. In the ongoing battle between tech progress and human
identity, Skull and Bones represents a dark and unwavering commitment to preserving what they believe to be humanity’s
true form, regardless of the cost.
