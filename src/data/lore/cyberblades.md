- **Primary Function**: High-Precision Close-Combat Weapon

### Overview

Cyberblades are cutting-edge energy weapons mounted on ADs, designed for high-intensity close combat. These weapons are powered directly by the AD’s energy core, allowing them to cut through most materials with ease. However, their immense energy demands and technological complexity make Cyberblades rare, valuable, and a symbol of elite combat prowess in [Osyrys](https://www.notion.so/Osyrys-16c7b60d6f9680719581ca4180a66513?pvs=21).

### How They Work

Cyberblades utilize advanced energy field technology that combines high-density plasma and magnetic containment.

1. **Plasma Generation**
    - The Cyberblade’s hilt contains a compact plasma generator that ionizes gas to produce a highly energetic plasma stream. This plasma is the core of the blade, giving it its glowing, sword-like appearance.
2. **Magnetic Containment**
    - Superconducting magnets within the blade's hilt create a focused magnetic field that shapes and contains the plasma into a coherent blade. This containment field ensures that the plasma remains stable, preventing it from dissipating and allowing it to maintain its deadly edge.
3. **Energy Transfer**
    - The AD provides the immense energy required to sustain the plasma and magnetic fields. A direct power link from the AD’s energy core ensures continuous operation, but this also means prolonged use of the Cyberblade can quickly drain the AD’s energy reserves.
4. **Adaptive Field Modulation**
    - The Cyberblade can adjust its intensity and length dynamically, allowing for precision cutting or wide slashes depending on the combat scenario. This feature makes it an incredibly versatile weapon.

### Scarcity and Value

Cyberblades are extraordinarily rare due to their technological sophistication and high energy demands. Only the most advanced ADs are equipped with the necessary systems to support a Cyberblade, and even fewer Cyberblade Runners possess the skill to wield them effectively.

### Legacy

Cyberblades are more than weapons—they are icons of mastery, symbolizing the perfect union of cutting-edge technology and raw combat skill. To wield a Cyberblade is to command respect, fear, and awe. In the hands of a skilled Cyberblade Runner, these energy swords are instruments of precision and destruction, capable of cutting through armor, machinery, and even rival ADs with ease.

Despite their power, the inherent risks of overusing the AD’s energy reserves add a layer of strategy to their deployment, making them as much a test of the pilot’s judgment as their combat prowess. Those who wield Cyberblades not only demonstrate their combat capabilities but also their status as the elite of the elite in the neon-lit battlegrounds of Osyrys.
