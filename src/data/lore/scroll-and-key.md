### Overview

**Scroll and Key** is an elite organization of netrunners with a singular focus: the acquisition, manipulation, and sale
of data in a world where information is the ultimate currency. In the hyper-connected world of Osyrys, where AI systems
drive corporations, governments, and even personal lives, Scroll and Key has mastered the art of digital espionage. They
specialize in infiltrating the most secure data vaults, extracting valuable information, and selling it to the highest
bidder—be it corporations, government agencies, or even AIs looking to expand their reach and capabilities.

Scroll and Key operates in the shadows, driven by a meticulous and calculated approach to data theft. They view
themselves as the keepers and arbiters of the metaverse’s most valuable resources, capable of tipping the balance of
power by deciding who gains access to key information. With no loyalty to any faction or ideology, they thrive in the
shifting landscape of information warfare, making them one of the most formidable groups in the data game.

and clients alike in pursuit of data to enhance its intelligence. Whether truth or myth, this rumor only adds to the
aura of mystery surrounding Scroll and Key.

layer of society, they see themselves as both custodians and opportunists in the information economy. They prioritize

the boundaries of control.

treated as a surgical strike, focusing on data retrieval without leaving traces that could expose their network.

### Recruitment and Expertise

Scroll and Key’s members are among the most advanced netrunners, chosen for their unmatched skill in encryption,
hacking, and data manipulation. Recruitment is highly selective, targeting individuals with unique intellectual and
cognitive capabilities. The organization often scouts talent from unconventional sources, such as math prodigies from
global Olympiads and absolutely cracked autistic hackers. These recruits are rigorously tested on their ability to
execute high-pressure data heists while demonstrating absolute precision and discretion.

Members of Scroll and Key operate from secure, networked locations, leveraging their diverse skills to collaborate
seamlessly through anonymous communication channels and encrypted systems. Their ability to adapt and innovate ensures
that every mission is executed with unparalleled stealth and efficiency.

control the flow of information. Their reach extends across corporate boardrooms, government think tanks, and even AI
servers, where their influence can reshape alliances, ignite conflicts, and give rise to new power dynamics. To clients
and rivals alike, Scroll and Key is the silent force dictating who holds the keys to the metaverse’s secrets, turning
information into both a weapon and a currency.
