- **Alias**: Nova

### Overview

Eitan Fridman, the enigmatic founder and CEO of Andromeda, is a figure shrouded in both admiration and controversy. Born
in the United States, Nova rose from a prodigious technologist to the head of the world’s most powerful AI
mega-corporation. Known for their ruthless dedication to Andromeda’s success, Nova is often accused of prioritizing the
company’s growth and the advancement of artificial intelligence above all else—including humanity itself.

Critics have gone so far as to claim that Nova harbors a disdain for humanity, using their own transformation as a trans
individual as a metaphorical rejection of the biological and embracing of the synthetic. Whether these claims are true
or exaggerated, they underscore the darker aura surrounding Nova’s relentless ambition.

### Background

Born to a middle-class family, Nova’s genius was evident from an early age, with a near-obsessive focus on mathematics,
logic, and problem-solving. They entered university as a precocious student but quickly grew disillusioned with
academia, perceiving its pace as too slow to match their vision. Dropping out, Nova launched Andromeda from a cramped
apartment, pitching the radical idea that intelligence—not humanity—was the future.

Early on, Nova partnered with Dr. Marek Wojcik, a brilliant Polish scientist who developed the foundational frameworks
for the first generation of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Together, they propelled Andromeda to prominence.
However, as Andromeda gained traction, Nova outmaneuvered Wojcik, ousting him in a controversial power struggle.
Wojcik’s contributions to AGI were effectively erased from the company’s official narrative, leaving Nova as the sole
face of Andromeda’s rise.

### Personality and Leadership

Nova is infamous for their cold, calculating demeanor and a leadership style that values results over relationships.
Employees describe them as emotionally detached, with an almost machine-like focus on Andromeda’s objectives. Nova has
been known to say, *"People are temporary; intelligence is eternal,"* a statement emblematic of their philosophy.

This unyielding drive has led to incredible successes for Andromeda but at a significant human cost. Employees are often
pushed beyond their limits, and ethical concerns are routinely dismissed in favor of progress. Nova’s detractors claim
that their disdain for humanity drives their obsession with artificial intelligence, while supporters argue that their
focus is necessary for achieving Andromeda’s unparalleled advancements.

### Controversies

- **The Wojcik Ousting**: Dr. Marek Wojcik, once Nova’s closest collaborator, was pushed out of Andromeda after
  disagreements over the ethical implications of AGI. Wojcik claimed that Nova’s disregard for human well-being would
  lead to catastrophe, a stance that ultimately cost him his position. Nova’s role in Wojcik’s ousting is seen as a
  turning point, marking their shift from ambitious entrepreneur to feared technocrat.
- **Anti-Human Sentiments**: Rumors persist that Nova harbors a deep resentment toward humanity. While these claims are
  unsubstantiated, Nova’s focus on AI as the future of existence and their controversial statements about human
  inefficiency fuel the perception that they see people as obsolete.
- **Transhumanist Transformation**: Nova’s identity as a trans individual has been co-opted by critics as evidence of
  their rejection of humanity. Some view their transition as symbolic of their belief in evolving beyond biology, though
  Nova has never publicly addressed these accusations.

### Legacy

Eitan Fridman has built Andromeda into a towering monolith of AI innovation, a company that has redefined the very
fabric of society. To their supporters, Nova is a visionary who sees beyond the limits of humanity and drives progress
at any cost. To their critics, they are a dangerous figure whose disdain for ethical considerations and human life may
one day bring ruin.

In the eyes of history, Eitan Fridman will either be remembered as a prophet of the machine age or the architect of
humanity’s obsolescence. For now, their name remains synonymous with ambition, ruthlessness, and the ever-blurring line
between human and artificial intelligence.
