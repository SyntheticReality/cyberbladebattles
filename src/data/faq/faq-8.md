question: "Where does the game take place?"
---
The game is set in the **City of Osyrys**, a sprawling neon megacity. Battles unfold across environments designed for full-body traversal and total freedom of movement: your combat unit is hyper-versatile and can reach nearly any surface.

The current playable area is the **Minnie’s Skybar District**, which includes:

- **Minnie’s Skybar**: A towering nightclub and social hub, this is where every match begins.
- **The Cyberdome**: The main competitive arena. Symmetrical, vertical, and designed for fast-paced, close-quarters combat.
- **Surrounding Rooftops**: Interconnected high-rises that support freeform traversal, surprise attacks, and mid-air duels.

More zones are coming soon, including street-level sectors, industrial complexes, and massive cargo platforms suspended in the sky.
