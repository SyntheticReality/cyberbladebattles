question: "What are Cybercoins? Are there in-game purchases (IAP)?"
---
Yes. Cybercoins are the gameâ€™s currency. You can purchase cosmetics for your combat unit (armours, cyberblades, hats, and more). Cybercoins are never pay-to-win. All gameplay mechanics are skill-based. Purchases are purely cosmetic or for progression flair.
